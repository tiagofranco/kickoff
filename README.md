#Kickoff

Kickoff is an HTML5/Sass barebones template based on [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com). It's made to be run on [Codekit](http://incident57.com/codekit/), with [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io) and [Garnish](https://github.com/paulozoom/garnish) for faster, easier development.

##Features
- [Normalizer](http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css) - A smarter, HTML5 ready, modern alternative to CSS resets;
- [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com) — Use HTML5 syntax without worries (for production you should create your own build on [modernizr.com](http://modernizr.com/))
- [jQuery](http://jquery.org) – Through Googles CDN, fallback to local copy;
- [Sass](http://sass-lang.com) - For sane, more modular, awesome stylesheets;
- Basic meta tags;
- .psd and .png icon files that you can use as templates to create your iOS, Android and favicon icons;
- .htaccess file that enables gzip compression and solves common problems such as webfonts access throught your domain and forcing IE to render with the lastest version;
- [robots.txt](http://www.robotstxt.org/) and
- [humans.txt](http://humanstxt.org/).
